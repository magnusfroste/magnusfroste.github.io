## Welcome to Frostes GitHub Page

I'm curious young man and love trying out new stuff, getting older only the last year. 
If I could I would be learning every day, because it is wonderful to get rid of old stuff.

## I'm very much into
* Kitesurfing and ice skating (when we have ice on lakes in Sweden)
* SaaS 
* Cloud
* Software Development
* Product Marketing /Management 
* Partner Management and building eco-systems
* Sales Development, partner and direct sales
* Close a deal feels always great ... 
* Business in general - awesome to build a sustainable business

## I have never booring
* I read "Team of Teams" or "how to become somethig, just following 10 simple steps. 
* Play with my children, grows to fast unfortunately
* Learn from Github, what else do you need?
* Help wife with crypto investments, she never remember passwords
* Spend monay on coffee, yep - we import everything to Sweden
* Watch Elon Musk, he is everywhere..
